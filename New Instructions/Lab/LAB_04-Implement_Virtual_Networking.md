# Lab 04 - Implement Virtual Networking

## Lab requirements

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using **East US** and **West Europe**. 

## Estimated time: 40 minutes

## Lab scenario 

Your global organization plans to implement virtual networks. These networks are in East US, West Europe, and Southeast Asia. The immediate goal is to accommodate all the existing resources. However, the organization is in a growth phase and wants to ensure there is additional capacity for the growth.

The **CoreServicesVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **East US** region. This virtual network has the largest number of resources. The network has connectivity to on-premises networks through a VPN connection. This network has web services, databases, and other systems that are key to the operations of the business. Shared services, such as domain controllers and DNS are located here. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network.

The **ManufacturingVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **West Europe** region, near the location of your organization's manufacturing facilities. This virtual network contains systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from, such as temperature, and needs an IP address space that it can expand into.

## Interactive lab simulations

There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

These virtual networks and subnets are structured in a way that accommodates existing resources yet allows for the projected growth. Let's create these virtual networks and subnets to lay the foundation for our networking infrastructure.

>**Did you know?**: It is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges to reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. Overlapping is a concern across the entire network, whether in the cloud or on-premises. Many organizations design an enterprise-wide IP addressing scheme to avoid overlapping and plan for future growth.

## Review the main points of the lab

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. 
+ When designing virtual networks it is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges. This will reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting.
+ A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security.
+ A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic. There are default incoming and outgoing rules which you can customize to your needs.
+ Application security groups are used to protect groups of servers with a common function, such as web servers or database servers. 

## Cleanup your resources

If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resource. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized.
